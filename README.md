Artemis Financial is a financial services firm dedicated to empowering its clients by creating customized financial plans while maintaining strict security standards. This emphasis safeguards sensitive customer data from unauthorized access. My role has been essential in achieving this goal, particularly through dependency testing, which identifies software vulnerabilities. Addressing these issues is vital for developing secure code, minimizing the risk of hacking, and building trust, which attracts and retains clients. During vulnerability assessments, I encountered challenges distinguishing real vulnerabilities from false positives (non-critical alerts). To enhance security, I implemented an SSL certificate and used HTTP POST methods for data transmissions, both of which are best practices. My future approach involves not only identifying potential weaknesses but also filtering out false positives to focus on genuine threats. To keep the software secure and operational, I conducted regular tests, including dependency checks after each code update, to detect new vulnerabilities early. Viewing projects directly in the Eclipse web browser simplifies development. A significant contribution has been the Vulnerability Assessment Report, which shows my ability to analyze and interpret vulnerability dataâ€”an essential skill for maintaining strong security.
